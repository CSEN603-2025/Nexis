GUC Internship System - Milestone 2 Documentation
German University in Cairo (GUC)
Media Engineering and Technology Department
Software Engineering Course - Spring 2025

1. Introduction
This document provides an overview of the GUC Internship System developed for Milestone 2 (MS2) as part of the Software Engineering course. The system is a React-based web application designed to manage internship processes at GUC, including:

Student applications

Company postings

Faculty evaluations

Report submissions

The focus of MS2 was front-end development, ensuring an intuitive and responsive user interface before backend integration in later milestones.

2. System Features
2.1 User Roles & Access
The system supports three main user roles:

Students

Apply for internships

Submit reports

Track application status

Companies

Post internship opportunities

Review student applications

Submit evaluations

Faculty/Admin

Approve/reject applications

Monitor submissions

Generate reports

2.2 Key Functionalities
Dashboard Views (Role-based)

Internship Listings & Filters

Application Forms

Document Upload (CVs, Reports)

Notifications & Alerts

Evaluation & Grading Interface

3. Technical Implementation
3.1 Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

Styling: CSS Modules (for component-specific styles)
