# GUC Internship System - Nexis

## Overview
The GUC Internship System (Nexis) is a front-end web application developed as part of the Software Engineering course (Spring 2025) at the German University in Cairo. This project, built for Milestone 2, focuses on designing and implementing a prototype for managing internship applications, enrollments, assessments, and evaluations. The system is developed using **React.js** and **CSS**, adhering to UI/UX principles outlined in the course and guided by the assigned Product Manager.

The application serves multiple user roles:
- **Companies**: Register, post internships, review applications, and evaluate interns.
- **Students/PRO Students**: Apply for internships, submit reports, and manage profiles.
- **SCAD Office/Faculty Members**: Manage company applications, review reports, and monitor statistics.

This repository contains the front-end code, utilizing dummy data to simulate functionalities without a backend or database.
